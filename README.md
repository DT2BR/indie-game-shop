# Game Store Prototype

This is a small project built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The goal is to create a simple **web platform for showcasing and selling games**.  

Currently, it includes a demo of the classic **Snake Game** as an example of how a game might be displayed and played directly on the site.

## Features
- Basic storefront layout with HTML + CSS
- Snake game demo (JavaScript)
- Simple and lightweight design

## Future Plans
- Add more game demos
- Improve UI/UX for browsing
- Make a scoreboard for each game
