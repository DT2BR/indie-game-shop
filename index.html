  <h3>About This Project ヾ(｡･ω･)ｼ</h3>
  <p>
    This is a small personal project i made for the love of web dev and gaming.  
</p>
    <p>
        The goal is to build a simple and friendly game shop website where both players and indie developers  
    can easily explore, share, and enjoy fun little games together.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, only a few prototype games are available — each made for learning and inspiration.  
    More features and improvements will be added step by step as the project grows.  
    Thank you for visiting and have fun playing!!!!
  </p>
